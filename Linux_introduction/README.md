## ðŸ“Œ 1. What is Linux?
Linux is an **open-source operating system (OS)** based on **Unix**.  
It is widely used in servers, desktops, mobile devices, and embedded systems.  
Key features:  
- Free and open-source.  
- Secure and stable.  
- Highly customizable.  
- Used in most modern servers and cloud systems.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ 2. How to Install Linux?
Linux can be installed in different ways:  
- Directly on a computer as the main operating system.  
- Alongside Windows (dual boot).  
- Inside a virtual machine (using VirtualBox/VMware).  
- On cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP).  

---

## ðŸ“Œ 3. How to Download & Install Linux (Ubuntu) on a Windows PC?
There are multiple ways to run Ubuntu on a Windows system without fully replacing Windows.
Here are the recommended methods:

1. WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
â€¢	Run Linux directly inside Windows without a virtual machine.
â€¢	Install Ubuntu easily from the Microsoft Store.
â€¢	Best for developers who want Linux tools alongside Windows apps.
â€¢	Quick setup:
                wsl --install

2. VirtualBox
â€¢	Install Oracle VirtualBox and create a virtual machine (VM).
â€¢	Let you run Ubuntu as a guest OS inside Windows.
â€¢	Great for safe learning, testing, and experimenting with Linux.

3. Cloud Platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
â€¢	Create and run Ubuntu servers on cloud providers like AWS EC2, Azure VM, or Google Cloud Compute Engine.
â€¢	Ideal for practicing Linux server administration and DevOps.
â€¢	Offers real-world server experience.

4. Vagrant
â€¢	A developer-friendly tool to set up and manage Linux environments quickly.
â€¢	Works with VirtualBox, VMware, and other VM providers.


## ðŸ“Œ 4. Difference Between Linux and Windows  

| Feature           | Linux                           | Windows                     |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Cost              | Free & Open-source             | Paid (licensed)             |
| Security          | More secure (less malware)     | More vulnerable             |
| Customization     | Highly customizable            | Limited                     |
| Performance       | Lightweight and fast           | Requires more resources     |
| Usage             | Servers, Developers, Sysadmins | Home & business users       |

## ðŸ“Œ 5. Software Remote Location Server Tools
Linux provides several tools to **remotely connect and manage servers**:  
- **SSH (Secure Shell)** â†’ Connect to servers securely.  
- **Telnet** â†’ Legacy tool (not secure).  
- **VNC / RDP** â†’ Remote desktop access.  
- **SCP / SFTP** â†’ File transfer between systems.
- **AnyDesk** â†’ Free for personal use, paid plans for businesses.

## ðŸ“Œ 6. What are Kernel, Bootloader, and Shell?
- **Kernel** â†’ The core of the OS that manages hardware and system resources.  
- **Bootloader** â†’ The program that loads the OS when the system starts. 
                  ( GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) is a widely used boot loader in the LinuxÂ® world. It's the initial program that kicks into action when you power on your computer, responsible for loading the operating system kernel into memory. )
- **Shell** â†’ Interface between the user and the OS (e.g., Bash). 
                        
---

## ðŸ“Œ 7. Desktop Environment
A **desktop environment (DE)** provides the graphical interface (GUI) of Linux.  
Examples:  
- **GNOME**  
- **KDE Plasma**  
- **XFCE**  
- **Cinnamon**  

---

## ðŸ“Œ 8. Linux System Architecture
Linux is structured in layers:  
1. **Hardware** â†’ CPU, RAM, storage, etc.  
2. **Kernel** â†’ Manages hardware & system resources.  
3. **System Libraries** â†’ Provide functions for applications.  
4. **System Utilities** â†’ Core commands (cp, mv, ls, etc.).  
5. **User Applications** â†’ Software installed by users.

---

## ðŸ“Œ 9. Information About Hardware
Linux provides commands to check system hardware:  
- `lscpu` â†’ CPU details.  
- `lsblk` â†’ Storage details.  
- `free -h` â†’ RAM usage.  
- `lspci` â†’ PCI devices.  
- `lsusb` â†’ USB devices.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ 10. Linux File System
- Linux uses a **hierarchical file system** starting with the root (`/`).

## ðŸ“Œ 11. Difference Between Linux and Unix  

| Aspect        | Linux                         | Unix                          |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Source Code   | Open-source                   | Mostly proprietary            |
| Cost          | Free                          | Commercial (paid)             |
| Hardware      | Runs on almost any hardware   | Limited hardware support      |
| Development   | Community-driven              | Developed by specific vendors |

## ðŸ“Œ 12. States of Processes in Linux
A process in Linux can be in different states:  
- **Running (R)** â†’ Actively using CPU.  
- **Sleeping (S)** â†’ Waiting for resources.  
- **Stopped (T)** â†’ Suspended by user.  
- **Zombie (Z)** â†’ Process finished but entry remains in process table.
