## Why Text-Processing Matters

DevOps engineers often need to filter logs, extract fields from structured text, and perform one-off transformations. The `grep` tool searches for patterns and prints matching lines. The GNU manual notes that `grep` reads one or more files and prints each line that matches a pattern ([man7.org](https://man7.org)). This makes it ideal for quickly checking whether an error string appears in a log.

The `sed` stream editor goes further by performing in-place substitutions and other text transformations ([man7.org](https://man7.org)). `awk` is a full-fledged programming language for processing delimited fields. The POSIX manual states that `awk` executes programs specialized for textual data manipulation and acts on lines and fields ([man7.org](https://man7.org)).

Because each tool has different strengths — `grep` for simple matching, `sed` for stream editing, and `awk` for field-based scripting — understanding when and how to use them is essential. The following examples show how a DevOps engineer can leverage these commands when working with a log file named `app.log`.

## AWK

`awk` operates on input records (by default each line) and splits them into fields separated by whitespace. Patterns and actions can be specified so that only lines matching a pattern are processed. This makes `awk` ideal for extracting columns and creating summaries.

### Commands, Descriptions, and Use Cases

| Command                                               | Description & Use Case                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `awk '{print}' app.log`                               | Print every line; useful for verifying that `awk` can read the file before applying filters.              |
| `awk '{print $1, $2}' app.log`                        | Print the first two fields (e.g., timestamp and log level) for each line.                                 |
| `awk '{print $1, $2, $5}' app.log`                    | Extract columns 1, 2, and 5 — helpful when logs contain message codes in specific positions.              |
| `awk '/INFO/ {print $1, $2, $5}' app.log`             | Only process lines containing the string INFO and show selected fields; useful for extracting informational messages. |
| `awk '/DEBUG/ {print $1, $2, $3, $5}' app.log`        | Same as above but for debug logs; can filter verbose output when troubleshooting.                         |
| `awk '/INFO/ {count++} END {print count}' app.log`     | Count the number of info messages; useful for quick statistics.                                          |
| `awk '/INFO/ {count++} END {print "Count of INFO:", count}' app.log` | Similar to previous but prints a label with the count. |
| `awk '$2 >= "07:51:54" && $2 <= "07:52:01" {print $2,$3,$4}' app.log` | Filter log entries within a specific time range based on the second field (time); helps isolate events around an incident. |
| `awk 'NR >=2 && NR <=10 {print NR}' app.log`          | Print the line numbers from record 2 to 10; useful for examining a specific portion of a log.            |

### Use Cases for DevOps

- **Log Summarisation** – Count occurrences of errors or warnings by incrementing counters within an `END` block.
- **Parsing Configuration Files** – Extract key/value pairs or specific columns from CSV/TSV data.
- **On-the-Fly Reporting** – Generate quick reports with calculated fields (e.g., average response time) by performing arithmetic on fields.
- **Data Transformation** – Reformat logs before sending to monitoring tools by printing selected fields or changing delimiters.

## SED

`sed` is a non-interactive stream editor used to perform substitutions, insertions, and deletions on text streams. It reads the input line by line, applies commands, and writes the result to standard output.

### Commands, Descriptions, and Use Cases

| Command                                               | Description & Use Case                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sed -n '/INFO/p' app.log`                            | Print only lines containing INFO. The `-n` option suppresses the default printing, and the `p` command prints matches. This can be used as a `grep` replacement when further editing is required. |
| `sed 's/INFO/LOG/g' app.log`                          | Replace all occurrences of INFO with LOG on every line; useful for normalizing log levels before feeding them into an aggregator. |
| `sed -n -e '/INFO/=' app.log`                         | Show the line numbers of lines containing INFO. The `=` command prints the current line number when a match is found. |
| `sed -n -e '/INFO/=' -e '/INFO/p' app.log`            | Print the line number and the line itself for each INFO match.                                            |
| `sed '1,10 s/INFO/LOG/g' app.log`                     | Perform the substitution only on lines 1–10; helps test changes on a subset of data.                      |
| `sed '1,10 s/INFO/LOG/g; 1,10p; 11q' app.log`         | Substitute and print the first ten lines, then quit (`q`) at line 11. This is useful for previewing changes without reading the entire file. |

### Use Cases for DevOps

- **Inline Edits in Configuration Files** – Update configuration parameters across multiple lines using range addresses and the `-i` option (with backups).
- **Format Transformation** – Remove, replace, or insert text (e.g., converting date formats, updating log prefixes) before ingestion into monitoring systems.
- **Quick Pattern Filtering** – Similar to `grep` but with extra context; for example, printing line numbers or restricting edits to a given range.

## Other Useful Commands

| Command                          | Description & Use Case                                                                                   |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `head -n 5 app.log`              | Display the first five lines; useful for checking the beginning of a log or file header.                 |
| `tail -n 10 app.log`             | Display the last ten lines; often used to see the most recent log entries.                               |
| `tail -f app.log`                | Continuously stream appended lines; ideal for real-time monitoring of logs during deployments.            |
| `sort app.log | uniq -c`         | Sort and count unique lines; this combination helps identify how many times each identical log line occurs. |
| `cut -d' ' -f1 app.log`          | Use whitespace as the delimiter and extract the first field; helpful for pulling timestamps or hostnames. |
| `df -h`                          | Report disk usage in human-readable units. DevOps teams monitor disk consumption to avoid outages.       |
| `du -sh /var/log`                | Show the total size of the `/var/log` directory; helps estimate log storage consumption.                |
| `top`                            | Display real-time system resource usage (CPU, memory, load). Useful for diagnosing performance problems. |

## Differences Between AWK and SED

Both `awk` and `sed` can filter and transform text, but they excel at different tasks. The table below highlights key distinctions.

| Aspect             | AWK                                              | SED                                              |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose            | Field-oriented pattern scanning and processing language | Stream editor for filtering and transforming text |
| Input Handling     | Treats each line as a record and splits it into fields; fields are accessed via `$1`, `$2`, etc. | Operates on a continuous stream of characters; pattern space contains the current line, and operations can be restricted by line numbers or patterns |
| Capabilities       | Supports arithmetic, conditionals, loops, and functions; can perform summarization and complex reports | Provides substitution (`s`), deletion (`d`), insertion, and line printing (`p`); works well for simple find-and-replace or line-based edits |
| Typical Use        | Extract or manipulate columns, perform calculations, generate structured reports | Substitute patterns, insert or delete lines, apply bulk edits across a file |
| Learning Curve     | Requires understanding of scripting constructs but offers more power | Easier to learn for basic substitutions and line filtering |
